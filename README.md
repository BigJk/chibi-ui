``chibi-ui`` is a experimental UI framework to create native desktop applications using web technologies, while avoiding shipping a browser with the application. It uses [quickjs](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs) as the JavaScript engine and makes [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) available to the JavaScript code.
